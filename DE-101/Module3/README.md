## Module 3 Homework
### Download Tableau and create Capstone project
I used the [London Airbnb dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/labdmitriy/airbnb) from Kaggle, it is necessary to create a tool that should answer the question in which area it is worth renting a room and analyze the top offers (by occupancy) in that area.

In order to find a new object, you need to choose the most attractive neighbourhood and compare specific objects. Neighbourhoods and listings should be compared by the following criteria:
- Number of objects
- Average price
- Average occupancy (load)
- Room type
- Number of bedrooms

The dashboard should answer these questions and analyze the top offers (by occupancy) in the area.
To solve the problem, I decided to use this data from the dataset: listings.csv, listings_summary.csv, reviews_summary.csv and neighborhood.geojson
